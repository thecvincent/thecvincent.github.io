  <p><strong>Course Pre-requisites, Co-requisites, and/or Other Restrictions</strong></p>
  <p>This is a non-audition choir. However to enjoy this singing experience, student singers should have the ability to match pitches and the ability to learn their part and sing in an ensemble. Recordings and midi-files may be provided or recommended to help. Students will be expected to attend and participate in ALL classes/rehearsals.</p>
  <p><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
  <p>This class is designed for student singers at UTD, for college credit, and as an outreach to singers from the surrounding communities as a part of UTD outreach to the community. This semester UTD CC will perform a wide variety of music.</p>
  <p><strong>ATTENDANCE POLICY</strong></p>
  <p>Rehearsals and performances: Attendance at all performances and rehearsals is mandatory. The concerts take the place of a final examination. Additional rehearsals will be announced well in advance. Attendance is required and will affect the course grade. You are allowed one unexcused absence. You may attend musical concerts here at UTD or in the Dallas metroplex and submit a two-page review of the concert to make up no more than four absences (see below). Please don’t abuse this privilege; I really need you in here the majority of the time. Please be on time for rehearsals; our time together is limited and must be used efficiently. Late arrival will not be tolerated. If you are not there when I take attendance, you will be marked absent. </p>
  <hr>
  <p><strong>Student Learning Objectives/Outcomes</strong></p>
  <p>Students will demonstrate mastery of musical notation in choral music. Students will employ effective vocal technique within a choral setting. Students will demonstrate understanding of the stylistic elements of musical interpretation and employ them in their performance of advanced repertoire.
  </p><hr>
  <p><strong>Required Textbooks and Materials</strong></p>
  <p>You will need a black, 3-ring binder with pockets for this class. Please purchase it by the second class session. All original music issued for this course is the property of UTD and must be returned in good condition. You will be expected to pay the replacement cost of any missing or damaged music. Please remember that music scores are very expensive and can be difficult to replace. Please be careful! Use pencil only to mark original scores; no pens or highlighters, please! If you wish to use highlighters, please copy the music at your own expense. Please bring a pencil to every class to make notes about direction, text, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>Assignments &amp; Academic Calendar</strong></p>
  <p>This is a performance course. Attendance at rehearsals and concerts is mandatory and replaces exams and assignments. Please check your schedule now – work, other activities, travel, etc. are not an excuse to miss rehearsal. No exceptions. </p>
  <p>You are encouraged to strengthen your choral ear, by attending other choral/musical/ UTD concerts. You may choose the concert from the UTD Arts and Humanities event list at http://www.utdallas.edu/ah/events/. It must be a concert event (not a play or dance show). These concerts are free to UTD students. Off-campus performances may be substituted only with prior approval of the instructor. If you choose to attend concerts off-campus, the admission cost is your responsibility. </p>
